# Spring boot
Before Spring boot we needed multiple frameworks to build application.
* Build a REST API - we needed Spring,Spring MVC,Tomcat,JSON conversion.
* Write unit tests - We needed Spring Test,JUnit,Mockito


  But now Spring boot has grouped them together into a bunch of starter projects which we can use to build different types of applications.

* Web Application & Rest API - Spring Boot starter web(consists - spring-webmvc,spring-web,spring-boot-starter-tomcat,spring-boot-starter-json)
* Unit Tests - Spring boot starter test
* Talk to database using JPA - Spring boot data JPA
* Talk to database using JDBC - Spring boot starter JDBC
* Secure your web application or REST API - spring boot starter security
